1. 'first pcn using numpy', dated:7/8/17
	 made a perceptron for iris,  achieved 80% accuracy (best)
	 , 	clearly not enough.
		
		questions raised:
			1. why isn't there a pattern in eta_vs_error and epochs_vs_error?

			2. works without normalization





2. 'pcn with random and mlp', dated:7/8/17

	 made a perceptron for iris,  achieved 
	 avg- error: 5%
	 max error: 6.6% 
	 points observed:
		 USED SHUFFLE in list and saw a boost in performance

		  erratic relation between epochs and eta still did not resolve

	made MLP for iris,
		 pretty much same performance like pcn with random 

		 points raised:
		  	MLP without random has better performance than pcn without random

		  	no. of nodes required if confusion matrix is used for validmeanerr is much less than squaremean( 4 and 1)

		  	We don't need MLP for iris

		  	normalization is important here
